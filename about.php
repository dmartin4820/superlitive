        Superlitive pushes the definition of community from just a group of people living in the same area. For
        Superlitive, community refers to a collective embrace of one another. CommUNITY it valuing each others
        differences and using those differences to enrich the experience. Superlitive holds space for and supports
        LGBTQ, BIPOC, BLM, Asian American communities. We see far past the divisive lines of color, race, religion,
        sexuality and abilities. Diversity based on unity and equality is POWER. This is commUNITY to its highest
        degree. This is Superlitive.
